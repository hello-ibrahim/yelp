Hi,

My name is Ibrahim Ashfaq. This is my Capstone Project for my Certificate Program in Big Data, Data Analytics, and Predictive Modeling at Chang School. 

Abstract:

Consumer data has become increasingly important for companies to understand. Individual interests and demands vary from one consumer to another. It is essential to filter data and recognize the individual characteristics of customers so that they are more inclined to purchase a product or service. Recommender system is a technique to help achieve the goal of customer engagement. Recommender systems are put in place by creating an algorithm that recognizes different consumer habits and filters them individually. Companies like Netflix and Amazon market recommended movies or products to their customers on a regular basis. The focus for this project is looking into Yelp’s public data found from their website . Yelp is a huge platform where consumers review, rate, and document their visits to restaurants and attractions. Business and review data will be the focus for this project. There are several approaches in implementing a recommender system to this dataset, the focus on this project is going to look at content and collaborative based filtering models. The research question is how do the different filtering models compare and assist in creating recommendations for Yelp’s customers? Python will be used to read the data and implement the different recommender filtering methods of content and collaborative-based filtering. Content-based filtering is when the customer would be inclined to purchase a product that they have previously liked. To implement this similarity matrix will be implemented. For collaborative-based filtering recommendations are given to the customer based on what other people have rated certain products. For this method a technique based on alternating least squares (ALS) will be implemented. Location-based filtering methods such as clustering will be briefly touched up on to further understand and visualize the data further. By creating a successful recommendation system, we hope that new and old consumers will be drawn to Yelp for discovering new restaurants that appeal to their interests.
